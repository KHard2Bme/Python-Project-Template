### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past 4 years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.





### Requirements
---

Client wants to create a coffee sales dashboard for years 2019 through 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements.

- Primary KPI: Total sales from all countries

             - Total transactions
  
             - Average sales
  
             - Minimum and Maximun sales.
              
- Secondary KPI:  Chart showing total sales in relation to countries

              - Sales total in relation to coffee type, roast type, coffee size
  
              . Chart showing total sales in each country
  
              - line chart showing trend of coffee type purchases over time
  
              - Bar chart showing top customers who purchased coffee. 



### Data Sources
---

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by a ficticious company.






### Tools
---

- Excel - Data Cleaning, processing, analysis, report and dashboard creation.



      
## Data Pipeline
---

### 1. Data Cleaning

Data loading and inspection:
- Checking column header and rows for correct spelling, null values, extra spaces, datatypes and duplicates.

### 2. Data Processing
 
 Creation of customized columns utilizing the following formulas:
-  XLOOKUP(), IF(), IFERROR(),PROPER(), INDEX() & MATCH()


### 3. Data Analysis
 

Creation of Pivot tables, basic and customized charts

### 4. Report/Dashboard

Building of the dashboard as well as adding charts, timeline and slicers 
 

### Limitations
---


The original dataset has a column named Order Date which contains dates starting from 1/2/2019 through 8/18/2022.

There are missing dates in the Order Date column that total 638 days.

I used the MIN() and MAX() formulas to aid me in creating a date range series and then MATCH() to help pinpoint the missing dates.

The basic steps can be found in the "coffeeOrdersDataMissingdates.xlsx" file.


There are 12 months in each year except for year 2022 where we are missing September, October, November and December.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

1.What is the total sales, number of transactions, average sales, minimum and maximum sales for coffee in all regions from 2019 through 2022? by year? by country?

### Results from Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1.  The United States makes up 96% of total sales within all regions, Ireland providing 3% followed by United Kingdom with a mere 1%
  
2.  With majority of sales coming from the United States the largest demand is for coffee type Excelsa, roast Light, and coffee size 2.5kg.

3.  Customers without loyalty cards have a slightly higher total sales and transaction count overall compared to those with a card. There is no special services applied to the loyalty card; for example, product discounts, accruel of points the more you spend, BOGO sales and possibly more delivery times ( overnight/next day ).
 
#### [Overall sales with no card is $24,216 with 521 transactions while those with a card is $20,918 with 479 transactions]



### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- In order for the company to have more sales, special features and services need to be applied to the loyalty card.

- With a newly revamped loyalty card existing users would take advantage of the incentives and those without would be highly interested in applying for card; subscription and extra features fee can be applied.

- There needs to be more sales taking place within Ireland and the United Kingdom.

- A complete dataset would be beneficial in order to accertain the present health of the company and predict future trends; missing 683 days of information and the year 2022 missing 4 months of data.
