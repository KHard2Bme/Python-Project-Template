# Project Overview
---
I will be performing an App Review Sentiment Analysis on the Waze mobile app dataset so as to evaluate and understand the sentiments expressed in user reviews over a 15 year span; 2009 through 2023.</b> 

I will use data analysis techniques to determine whether the sentiments in these reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.</b>

I will also perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to answer a few questions derived along the way.</b>


 >note: The App Review Sentiment Analysis and EDA steps will be shown in detail within the Jupyter Notebook.


# Python Libraries Used
---
*pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlip, datetime


# Data Sources
---

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "WAZE_REVIEWS.csv" file obtained from Kaggle which contains real data.<br>

The dataset covers user reviews about the Waze app during years 2009 through 2023.<br>



# Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In my analysis I explore and answer the following questions:

1. From the distribution of ratings chart, which rating has the most reviews? Least reviews?
2. From the distribution of sentiments chart, What are the number of reviews for each sentiment?
3. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across ratings chart, the negative sentiment is at its highest in rating number 1. How many reviews make up this sentiment?
4. Based off the findings from the distribution of author apps versions chart, which version has the most reviews and which has the least?
5. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across apps chart, version 4.73.0.3 has more negative sentiments than version 3.9.4.0. How many negative reviews are in this sentiment? How many negative reviews are in 3.9.4.0?
6. Based off the findings from the distribution of years for reviews chart, which three years contained the most reviews and which year had the least amount of reviews overall?
7. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution by year chart, the year with the most negative sentiments is 2021.How many negative reviews were placed and the percentage out of all negative sentiments?
8.  Based off the findings from the year distribution by ratings chart, We see that in rating number 1 there is a large percent of reviews from year 2021 than any other year. How many reviews make up the positive, negative and neutral sentiments?

## Summary:
- Starbucks, Chipotle and Darden all have beta values less than 1, indicating that they are expected to be less volatile and sensitive to market movements.
- McDonalds and Yum both have negative values which suggest they move in opposite direction to overall market movements. Although rare, there are some stocks in the market that have a negative beta<br>

# Results from Findings
---
As a reminder, I will be making a determination of a wonderful stock to pick from the viewpoint of an investor who is risk averse.

 After performing a Quatitative Analysis of five well known stocks in the restaurant industry; (MCD) McDonalds, 
(SBUX) Starbucks, (CMG) Chipotle Mexican Grill, (YUM) Yum! Brands and (DRI) Darden Restaurants, within a one year time period of 3-20-2023 through 3-19-2024, the data shows that <b>(DRI) Darden Restaurants</b> would be the best choice.


  Factors which helped in the decision process were outcomes from the below statistical concepts:
 
 - <b>Comparative Analysis:</b>    Out of all five stocks we looked at SBUX experienced the most significant negative change, at approximately -7.53%.
  This left us with four stocks to analyze.

 - <b>Risk-Return Trade-off Analysis:</b>  CMG exhibited the highest risk out of all the stocks though having the highest average daily return.
  We would have to remove this stock from the lineup, leaving us with three.

 - <b>Performance against the S&P500:</b>  MCD and Yum both have negative values which suggest they move in opposite direction to overall market movements.
    For some, both stocks might be good because they act as a hedge against market downturns and can help reduce portfollio risks. For the average investor looking to make daily returns this might be a market risk. 
    This leaves us with DRI as the wonderful stock to purchase; beta value is 0.07123 which is far below a beta of 1.
